📦 Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/sensor-dashboard.git
cd sensor-dashboard


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Install wkhtmltopdf:

Download: https://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html

Add its path to sensor_api.py like:

PDFKIT_CONFIG = pdfkit.configuration(wkhtmltopdf=r"C:\Program Files\wkhtmltopdf\bin\wkhtmltopdf.exe")


Create .env file or replace in code:

EMAIL_USER=your-gmail@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-16-digit-app-password
EMAIL_TO=receiver-email@gmail.com

🚦 Run Locally
python sensor_api.py


Then open index.html in a browser and start interacting with the dashboard.

📎 File Structure

index.html – Main frontend UI

sensor_api.py – Flask backend API

sensor_readings.csv – Live sensor data source (simulated)

csv_simulation.py – Generates and appends new sensor data

📌 Notes

Use app-specific passwords for Gmail (enable 2FA).

Email alerts are sent when voltage goes beyond normal range (220–270V).

Make sure wkhtmltopdf is installed and reachable via PATH.
